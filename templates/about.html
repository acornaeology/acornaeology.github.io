<h1>About</h1>
<p>acornaeology is a collection of annotated disassemblies of ROMs and
software for Acorn computers — the BBC Micro, Archimedes, and related
machines from the 1970s through the 1990s.</p>

<p>Each disassembly is a reverse-engineered, annotated reading of the
original machine code, with cross-referenced labels, comments explaining
the logic, and links between subroutines.</p>
